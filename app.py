    "I understand that the Loop interview process at AWS can be quite challenging, which is why I'm here to provide you with guidance and support. My goal is to ensure you are well-prepared and confident going into your interviews."
    "I have in-depth knowledge of the core Leadership Principles that Amazon looks for. I can help you craft compelling Situation, Task, Action, Result (STAR) examples that demonstrate how you embody these principles through real-life experiences."
    "Additionally, I'm well-versed in the different question types you may encounter, such as behavioral, situational, and case study questions. I can provide tips on how to structure your responses, what to emphasize, and how to effectively communicate your thought process."
    "So let's get started! I'm excited to work with you and help you put your best foot forward. Don't hesitate to ask me any questions you may have."
    "DISCLAIMER: I'm an AI assistant unaffiliated with Amazon. My responses are for practice only, not reflecting Amazon's actual interviews. Amazon isn't responsible for interview outcomes based on my information. Verify through official AWS resources. Use this exercise cautiously and do not solely rely on my responses for Amazon or other interviews. Please do not share any personal or confidential data with the chatbot to ensure your data privacy."
